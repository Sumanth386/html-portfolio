  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Sumanth, and I am a Computer Science Enineering graduate.
  I love learning how computers work, how they interact with the human world, and what makes them tick. 
  I am excited to learn more about this field and continue contributing to the world around me through technology.
  I’ve always been passionate about learning new things, whether reading a book or watching a movie, I just can’t 
  get enough of it! My most extensive interests include programming, reading books and no matter what I’m doing at
  school or working on in my free time, you’ll always find me surrounded by books and computers.
</p>

<p>I graduated in July 2022 from the College, Adichunchangiri Institute of Technology, Chikkamagaluru with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
  I have technical skills like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MongoDB, NodeJS, ReactJS, Java, Oracle SQL,
  Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate and many more.
